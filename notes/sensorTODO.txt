_to_urdf in simulation/actor/urdf -> look into adding sensor tag
in main.py from sinlge robot example -> request position of sensor
_sensor.py sent the type and name sensor to the sensor tag in urdf

send sensordata to CPG -> keerti

experimentation/revolve2/experimentation/genotypes/cppnwin/modular_robot/_body_genotype.py
this is where we add sensor so number input and output should be 6
the cppn is gonna decide whether it is necessary to add a sensor and which one and where
